### For the server side:
SPRING Boot framework <br />

<br />
Spring boot is a suite, pre-configured, pre-sugared set of frameworks/technologies to reduce boiler plate configuration providing you the shortest way to have a Spring web application up and running with smallest line of code/configuration out-of-the-box. 

####Swagger

<br />
Swagger is a powerful open source framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps you design, build, document, and consume your RESTful APIs.

####JUnit
To assure the system works correctly we have used the JUnit framework, which helps us to rapidly and efficiently write tests for our code.
